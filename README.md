# Ray the Plant

Ray the talking plant lets you know when it is thirsty, if the temperature is outside its range, and additional other.

In this tutorial, I will show you how to use a Particle Photon to test the moisture level of some soil. If the moisture falls outside a certain range (too wet or too dry) we will send a text message to a cell phone.

If you have any questions or a piece of this tutorial is unclear, I would encourage you to create an [issue](https://github.com/jordanskole/ray-the-plant/issues) and I will address it ASAP.
